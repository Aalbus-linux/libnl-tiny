LIBNL-TINY
==========

libnl-tiny is a tiny replacement for libnl versions 1 and 2

it was originally developed by openwrt and can be found in their
trunk repo in the path package/lib/libnl-tiny.

upstream URL: git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git (attention: HUGE)
web interface: 
http://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt.git;a=tree;f=package/libs/libnl-tiny

the version used in this fork is equivalent to upstream SVN rev 33657,
and comes with a much improved Makefile and other portability fixes
that make it possible to use libnl-tiny outside the openwrt source tree.

libnl-tiny is known to work without issues with at least:
iw, wpa-supplicant, kismet, aircrack-ng, libpcap

so far there are no known packages expecting libnl that cannot be built
against libnl-tiny.


BUILD/INSTALL
=============

make prefix=/usr DESTDIR=foo all install

you can place custom CFLAGS and other variables used in Makefile in config.mak.
the user supplied variables override the ones used in the Makefile.

if you need only a static library, run
make ALL_LIBS=libnl-tiny.a prefix=/usr DESTDIR=foo all install


LIBNL1_COMPAT
=============

if you compile a package against libnl-tiny, and get error messages about
nl_handle*, add -DLIBNL1_COMPAT to your CPPFLAGS or CFLAGS when you run
the packages configure script or Makefile.
